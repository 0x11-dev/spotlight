  <span class="post-date">Published Nov 15, 2015</span>
  <p>So I made a WordPress Theme. Why? Because I&rsquo;m sick of everything else on the internet. And that&rsquo;s not to say that there aren&rsquo;t some great themes out there. There are some truly incredible themes. And they do everything. The problem is, however, that I don&rsquo;t need everything. All I need is a simple page that is aesthetically pleasing, and quick. And that&rsquo;s about it. No frills, no fuss, no crazy configuration options, nothing.</p>

  <p>This has absolutely nothing to do with technology, but it&rsquo;s my blog, so I can do what I want. This past Memorial Day weekend, I had the most incredible chance to visit Yellowstone National Park. I’m embarrassed to say that I’ve lived less than two hours away from one of the largest National Parks in the United States for more than three years, and I’ve never made the trip. Once the weather warmed up, and we had a chance to get away for a full day, we gassed up the car, filled the coolers, and headed north.</p>

  <p>Windows 10 launched yesterday, and so being my naturally-curious self on all the latest and greatest in the tech world, I gave it a go. I got an ISO and started it up in VM Fusion on my Mac. This won&rsquo;t be an in-depth review on all the latest features and all that jazz. There are plenty of Tech Blogs out there that can perform a better review than I ever could.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Jul 15, 2015</span>
  <p>David Walsh, a popular Web Development blogger I follow, wrote a post a few months ago about the &#8220;Imposter Syndrome,&#8221; a common feeling that many developers have going into a new job, or even in their current position; a feeling of inadequacy or fear that someone is going to discover them as a &#8220;fake,&#8221; simply pretending to be competent in their field. As I was reading through his comments, I couldn&rsquo;t help but relate.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Jun 3, 2015</span>
  <p>About a month ago, I began working at Intermountain Healthcare, here in Utah, as a Systems Administrator. We have a bunch of monitoring software, one of which is called &#8220;Spectrum&#8221;. It searches for hardware errors or any other faults and then reports them to us. One of the most common reports that we find is that &#8220;C: 90% usage&#8221;, or something similar. Because the majority of the servers that we run are virtual, with a thin disk setup, they have relatively small drives (some starting as small as 25GB).</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Feb 20, 2015</span>
  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that I was terrified of the terminal. It&rsquo;s pretty daunting to be staring at a blank screen with a blinking cursor taunting you. Want to know something? It&rsquo;s not as scary as you might think. It would take years to master the command line, so don&rsquo;t expect to know everything all at once. Everyday, try and find little ways to slowly blend the terminal with basic tasks.</p>

  <p>(Happy Valentine&rsquo;s Day, ya&rsquo;ll. Get off the computer and go buy something nice for your woman.) Sometimes I like to pretend that I know stuff, when I really don&rsquo;t. Gulp is one of those things. :) I need to get better at finding solutions to a lot of the repetitive tasks that I do on a daily basis. Up until now, let&rsquo;s say I was about to push some production code to the web.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Jan 24, 2015</span>
  <p>At work this week, I had to download a bunch of compressed XML files, delete some duplicate files contained therein, recompress the files, and then reupload them to a server. The problem, however, is that whenever I tried to upload the files, I got a strange server error. After some trial and error, and some deep examination, I found that the hidden file &#8220;.DS_Store&#8221; was causing the server error issue. When I removed the hidden &#8220;.DS_Store&#8221; file, I had no more issues.</p>

  <p>Although my site is always a work in progress, (I&rsquo;ve still got plenty of things I need to do on it), I feel like it&rsquo;s in the final stages. Recently, I was trying to add the finishing touches by implementing a contact form. Mostly, to combat spam. I didn&rsquo;t want to throw my direct e-mail address out there, because that&rsquo;s just asking for an inbox full of viagra ads. The thing that I wanted to completely avoid was having any server-side (PHP) scripting, or databases.</p>

  <p>It seems that a year has ended, and new year resolutions are all on the rage again. Yeah, there&rsquo;s those typical ones such as joining a gym and getting in shape (although, I really think I might do it this year), etc. Here are five things I&rsquo;d like to quit doing this year. 1. Quit checking my Instagram likes Yeah, it&rsquo;s stupid, but really. I mean it. We all do it.</p>
