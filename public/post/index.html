  <p>So I made a WordPress Theme. Why? Because I&rsquo;m sick of everything else on the internet. And that&rsquo;s not to say that there aren&rsquo;t some great themes out there. There are some truly incredible themes. And they do everything. The problem is, however, that I don&rsquo;t need everything. All I need is a simple page that is aesthetically pleasing, and quick. And that&rsquo;s about it. No frills, no fuss, no crazy configuration options, nothing.</p>

  <p>This has absolutely nothing to do with technology, but it&rsquo;s my blog, so I can do what I want. This past Memorial Day weekend, I had the most incredible chance to visit Yellowstone National Park. I’m embarrassed to say that I’ve lived less than two hours away from one of the largest National Parks in the United States for more than three years, and I’ve never made the trip. Once the weather warmed up, and we had a chance to get away for a full day, we gassed up the car, filled the coolers, and headed north.</p>

  <p>David Walsh, a popular Web Development blogger I follow, wrote a post a few months ago about the &#8220;Imposter Syndrome,&#8221; a common feeling that many developers have going into a new job, or even in their current position; a feeling of inadequacy or fear that someone is going to discover them as a &#8220;fake,&#8221; simply pretending to be competent in their field. As I was reading through his comments, I couldn&rsquo;t help but relate.</p>

  <p>About a month ago, I began working at Intermountain Healthcare, here in Utah, as a Systems Administrator. We have a bunch of monitoring software, one of which is called &#8220;Spectrum&#8221;. It searches for hardware errors or any other faults and then reports them to us. One of the most common reports that we find is that &#8220;C: 90% usage&#8221;, or something similar. Because the majority of the servers that we run are virtual, with a thin disk setup, they have relatively small drives (some starting as small as 25GB).</p>

  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that I was terrified of the terminal. It&rsquo;s pretty daunting to be staring at a blank screen with a blinking cursor taunting you. Want to know something? It&rsquo;s not as scary as you might think. It would take years to master the command line, so don&rsquo;t expect to know everything all at once. Everyday, try and find little ways to slowly blend the terminal with basic tasks.</p>

Gulp is one of those things. :) I need to get better at finding solutions to a lot of the repetitive tasks that I do on a daily basis.

  <p>At work this week, I had to download a bunch of compressed XML files, delete some duplicate files contained therein, recompress the files, and then reupload them to a server. The problem, however, is that whenever I tried to upload the files, I got a strange server error. After some trial and error, and some deep examination, I found that the hidden file &#8220;.DS_Store&#8221; was causing the server error issue. When I removed the hidden &#8220;.DS_Store&#8221; file, I had no more issues.</p>

  <p>Although my site is always a work in progress, (I&rsquo;ve still got plenty of things I need to do on it), I feel like it&rsquo;s in the final stages. Recently, I was trying to add the finishing touches by implementing a contact form. Mostly, to combat spam. I didn&rsquo;t want to throw my direct e-mail address out there, because that&rsquo;s just asking for an inbox full of viagra ads. The thing that I wanted to completely avoid was having any server-side (PHP) scripting, or databases.</p>

  <p>We&rsquo;ve all had those professors/teachers that we just don&rsquo;t seem to mesh with. Recently, I had a professor with whom I could not set aside my differences. The class was about Mobile Application Development. I went into it thinking, &#8220;Wow, I&rsquo;m excited! Finally, I&rsquo;ll be able to create an iOS/Android application!&#8221; On the first day of the class, Mr. Barney walked in and said, &#8220;This is not a programming class.

I&rsquo;ll be creating a blog post here fairly soon on my conversion from WordPress to Jekyll for this blog, but in doing so, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of cool new things.

The code below might look daunting at first, but we’ll walk through it piece by piece to hopefully clear things up.</p>

  <p>Recently, I’ve really been getting fed up with WordPress. And here’s why. WordPress dates all the way back to 2001. It was originally developed as a simple blogging platform based off of MySQL and PHP. Close to fifteen years later, it’s become a web standard and is used as the Framework/CMS for more than 20% of all the websites on the internet. And that’s exactly the problem. WordPress has exploded into a million different forks and subprojects, and has been expanded to run an equal amount of themes and plugins.</p>

  <p>When I was 16 (yes, I&rsquo;m young, okay?), I had the idea for a Tech Blog. Not that it had never been done before or anything, but it&rsquo;s just that ever since the age of 9, technology is the only hobby or thing in my life that I&rsquo;ve consistently held interest in. I&rsquo;m not sure why I wanted to start one, but I just figured it would be a good way of tracking my progress and learning of various technologies, as well as helping others in anyway, if possible.</p>

  <p>For anyone who knows me even slightly well knows that I’m a huge fan of WordPress. I use it as my go-to CMS for all of the websites I create, whether for myself or for clients. It gives me the flexibility I need in a well designed format, and it gives my clients the ability to make changes to their own websites without knowing any code. Some people will give you a giant list of plugins that you have to download when first setting up your WordPress site.</p>

It’s light, portable, and inexpensive, yet it’s the most important piece of equipment that I own: a plastic bag. Last night, we spent the evening playing with steel wool and throwing sparks into circular patterns into the air. Add a little fill flash, and some creativity, and you’ve got a fun evening planned.</p>

  <p>By reading through the various posts and topics that I have on this website, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious to see that I&rsquo;m a fan of WordPress. It makes complex tasks incredibly simple and automated for users who want to create/build a website, but don&rsquo;t want to have to deal with code at all. For more advanced users who do want to tweak a bit more with code, WordPress is great for that as well.</p>

  <p>While I&rsquo;m sure there are a plethora of third-party applications that you can download to do this, why add something to your computer that would potentially slow it down when the functionality is already built-in? The ability is already built straight into the Quicktime app on your Mac. That&rsquo;s right! The same application that allows you to watch videos on your computer also allows you to record your screen. It&rsquo;s remarkably simple, and best of all &#8212; free!</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Jul 18, 2014</span>
  <p>Here’s a quick tip that, sadly, I just now discovered in Adobe Lightroom. I’d say I’m quite familiar with the tools and capabilities of Adobe Lightroom, however, one thing has always baffled me. While cropping an image, I could never get the crop tool to switch from landscape orientation to portrait. I like to constrain my cropping proportions so that if I ever need to print my images, I won’t have any letter boxing.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Jul 16, 2014</span>
  <p>Although this is changing with the advent of solid-state drives, most hard drives are mechanical, which means they are often the first part of a standard computer system to fail. Data is everything these days, and its up to you to protect it. But in the case of a drive failing, you have no excuse for not having a backup with the ease of RAID. Instead of waiting for a hard drive to fail, an easier approach can be taken.</p>

  <p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it. WordPress is popular, easy to use, and here to stay. It&rsquo;s estimated that more than 20% of the internet is currently running on the CMS. With drag-and-drop features, thousands of themes, and super-simple customization, it&rsquo;s easy to see why. That doesn&rsquo;t mean WordPress doesn&rsquo;t come without any quirks, though. One of those many quirks (annoyances, really) are the &#8216;categories&rsquo; feature. While it&rsquo;s a piece of cake to categorize posts into various sections, there&rsquo;s always been one thing that has bugged me.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Jul 1, 2014</span>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve been the go-to tech guy for family and friends for as long as I can remember. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve had someone come up to me asking, &#8220;My computer is SO slow. Can you fix it?&#8221; 99% percent of the time, this involves removing malware or virus infections. You&rsquo;re all very familiar with these: browser hijacking, tons of popups, and a computer running as slow as molasses.</p>
