Want to know what my most cherished and valuable piece of photography equipment is? You might be surprised. It’s not my beautiful Canon 6D. Nor is it my 24-70 F2.8 lens. It’s light, portable, and inexpensive, yet it’s the most important piece of equipment that I own: <em>a plastic bag</em>.

Last night, we spent the evening playing with steel wool and throwing sparks into circular patterns into the air. Add a little fill flash, and some creativity, and you’ve got a fun evening planned. Soon, it starts to sprinkle, and you think, “It’s a good thing I invested in a nice full-frame camera. It’s got weather sealing!” You wait a few more minutes, and the rain begins to pick up just ever-so-slightly. You think again to yourself, “It’s a good thing I invested in some ‘L’ Canon glass! It’s weather resistant!”

Soon, it’s an all-out downpour, and I reach into my gear bag for my trusty sidekick. I rip a small hole into the bottom of the bag, just the size of the lens opening, and the open end of the bag gently lays over the rest of the camera, allowing me to lift it up to peer through the eyepiece and view the image on the LCD screen.

Rewind four years ago to when I was a young Mormon Missionary, serving in the small town of Los Lunes, New Mexico. It was our day off, and a friend of mine wanted to go hiking. I grabbed my trusty Canon Rebel XTi, one of my few possessions, and we headed out. Halfway into the hike, the sky unloaded on us. We were absolutely drenched. Getting back into the car, I knew that my camera was in trouble. I did the best I could to protect the camera from the elements, carrying it underneath my shirt.

Sadly, it was a goner. No matter which lens I tried, I got the deadly “Error 00: No lens connected’ error.” I tore it apart, in hopes that letting it air out might fix the problem. No luck. I had definitely learned my lesson.

Back to last night, I’m grateful I had learned my lesson earlier, and not with the more expensive 6D counterpart. I learned my lesson, but here’s in hopes that you learn from my mistake, and not your own. Carry a plastic bag in your camera bag at all times. You’ll never know when you need it.
