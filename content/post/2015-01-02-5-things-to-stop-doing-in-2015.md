It seems that a year has ended, and new year resolutions are all on the rage again. Yeah, there's those typical ones such as joining a gym and getting in shape (although, I really think I might do it this year), etc. Here are five things I'd like to quit doing this year.

### 1. Quit checking my Instagram likes

Yeah, it's stupid, but really. I mean it. We all do it. We open up Instagram and are excited when we see 30+ likes, 4 comments, and 2 new followers. I won't say that I base my self-worth on it, but I do get a bit of a thrill when I post a great photograph, or come up with some whitty remark. I'm going to try my best to quit doing that. I love photography, and I'd call it more than a hobby, but I can get better at finding self-gratification from other peoples' acceptance.

### 2. Stop thinking that the grass will be greener

&#8220;I'll be happy when I'm married&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;If only I made more money&#8230;&#8221;. Stop. Please. Stop it. Happiness truly comes from gratitude. I need to work on being content with where I'm at, and simply finding joy in the journey. It's not a destination. I don't want to wish life away thinking, &#8220;If only, if only.&#8221;

### 3. Stop comparing

&#8220;Comparison is the theif of joy.&#8221; Are you ever happy with your love life, until you see another girl at the other table? Are you content and grateful with your talents, and ever-eager to hone them, until you see the successes of others? Are you happy with your job and your work, until you see a potentially better offer? There is always going to be someone or something better, and should you actually ever obtain that, you'd find something else to complain about.

### 4. Quit feeling guilty

People make mistakes. People change. And so do you. You live, you learn, you grow. The end. What happened in the past doesn't have to define you, unless you let it. Put on your big boy underwear, man up, and move on.

### 5. Stop feeling obligated

It's okay to say, &#8220;No.&#8221; Don't (always) make decisions based on what you think you *should* do. Make decisions based on what you WANT to do. It's your life, and you're going to have to live with the actions that you make. You have value, and your ruining your brand by undercharging.

That's my list. What does yours look like?
